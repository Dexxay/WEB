                            Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince
                            Gilligan. Set and filmed in
                            Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
                            overqualified, and dispirited
                            high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung
                            cancer. White turns to a
                            life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and
                            distribute crystal meth to
                            secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the
                            criminal underworld. The show
                            aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a
                            total of 62 episodes.

                        <p>Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series.
                            Gilligan wanted
                            to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist. "Television is
                            historically good at keeping its
                            characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades," he
                            said. "When I realized this,
                            the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is
                            toward change?" He added
                            that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.
