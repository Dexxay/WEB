                        <p>Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series.
                            Gilligan wanted
                            to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist. "Television is
                            historically good at keeping its
                            characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades," he
                            said. "When I realized this,
                            the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is
                            toward change?" He added
                            that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.
